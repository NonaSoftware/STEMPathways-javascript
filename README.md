This is learning assignment designed to help students learn to code in Javascript surrounding visualizing DNA and expanding upon open-source software

Below is a small take home assignment including some background reading and introduction to another DNA Visualizer tool

[Article 1](https://medium.com/lattice-automation/visualize-your-dna-sequences-with-seqviz-b1d945eb9684 )   
[Article 2](https://www.edvotek.com/quick-guide-visualizing-dna )
[BLAST Visualizer (follow the green arrow))](https://digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/slide1.html)

After finishing the articles above and making it through the short BLAST tutorial, weâ€™ll expand upon SeqViz by:
1. Explore some of the highlight property in SeqViz to expand your visualizer. Have a highlight on the first dozen nucleotides cyan
2. Highlight the second dozen (13-24) nucleotides
